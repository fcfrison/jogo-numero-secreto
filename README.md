# Guess the Number
This is a game developed in JavaScript. The objective is to guess an unknown number using the computer microphone.

This project was created as part of the course "JavaScript Validations and Speech Recognition" on the learning platform Alura. In the course, I learned how to use the SpeechRecognition API in JavaScript, validate user input, and build a simple game that allows users to guess a secret number using speech input. This project is my implementation of the game from the course, and it demonstrates the skills and knowledge I gained from taking the course.

To play the game, use the computer microphone to input your guess. If the number you guess is greater than the hidden number, the game engine will tell you that the unknown value is less. If the number you guess is less than the hidden number, the game engine will tell you that the unknown value is more.

The game ends when someone guesses the secret number. Can you figure out what it is?

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Use the computer microphone to input your guess.
3. If your guess is too high or too low, the game 3. engine will give you a hint.
4. Keep guessing until you hit the secret number and win the game!
Good luck and have fun!
